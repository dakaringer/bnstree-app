Project: BnS Tree

Skill Tree Simulator for Blade & Soul

This is a skill tree simulator for all classes of Blade & Soul. This was done possible by reading the source markup of the official Blade & Soul korean website.
This project is hosted on Github Pages with a custom domain (bnstree.com)


Disclaimer:

The following files (used for the skill tree itself) is made by ncsoft. 
Most of these were heavily modified by me for translation, fixing bugs and optimizing webpage + user experience.

data_skill-tooltip.js (split into separate files for each class)
data_skill-tooltip-attribute.js
training.min.js
training2.css
common.js (only used the functions relating to JSON)
category_data_XX.js
slot_data_XX.js
skill_data_XX.js

Background images are taken by me or found on the bns kr screenshot forum.
Skill images are directly from the bns kr website.

Major changes...

April 10, 2015 - This project was remade on the Bootstrap framework for responsive design.
Big credits to Jasny (https://github.com/jasny/bootstrap) for the Bootstrap extension and starting template.

April 11, 2015 - Site was restructured with Jekyll for easier content management and to reduce repeated codes.





How it works:

Most of the functions for the skill tree is defined in training.js. Modify this if you want to change its behavior.
The skills themselves are defined in each class folders. Modify skill_data_XX.js to edit the tooltips (most of the translations); modify category_data_XX.js to edit the list on the left; modify slot_data_XX.js to edit the tree.
data_skill-tooltip-attribute and data_skill-tooltip defines the behavior of displaying changes between talents on the tooltips. builds_XX.js have preset builds saved.

Other functions of the website are defined in extra.js


Class codes:
AS = assassin
BM = blade master
DE = destroyer
FM = force master
KF = kung-fu master
SM = lyn blade master
SU = summoner
WL = warlock





Jekyll:

Each page is structured using templates. 
Files in _includes has all the common parts needed to build a page. 
Files in _layout combine those parts with other elements files to compile a page for each index.html.
There are 9 index.html files total (1 for the main page located at the root; 8 for each class tree page located in each class folder). 
Each index.html file contains metadata/variables (for the templates) as well as content data for each page.
Also, changelog and build list for each class is handled by changelog.yamland builds.yaml respectively to iteratively handle them while compiling the pages.

The compiled sites are found in the _site folder (Do not modify the contents. They are automatically generated by Jekyll)





Styling:

Styesheets are compiled into 2 css file using SCSS located in the css folder. main.scss is for the main page; tree.scss is for the skill tree pages. Partial components for these styles are located in the _sass folder.
