title: BnS Tree - Skill Tree Simulator for Blade and Soul
---
<p class="lead">A fully English translated interactive skill tree simulator for Blade & Soul, a Korean Martial Fantasy MMORPG, with guides provided to help foreign players enjoy the game to its fullest.</p>
The skill trees are based on BnS KR. Skills may or may not be the same as the ones you would see in other servers. Everything is manually translated to English by me. Most skill names are accurate direct translations while some were given reasonable new names because they were difficult to translate. Some tooltips may be a bit different from the original for better consistency and clarity.

This project was made possible by using many parts of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes from the official BnS KR website. Some elements were modified for better presentation and some parts of the script was heavily modified to fix some bugs and behaviors and to add new features such as the build list, the save/load box, and URL generator. Background images are either from the official BnS KR website posted by users or captured by me.

This project is open sourced and is available on <a href="http://bit.ly/1AFTgca">Github</a>.  
In fact, this page is hosted with Github Pages.
